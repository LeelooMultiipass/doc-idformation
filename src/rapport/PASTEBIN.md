im processing a markdown file with pandoc into an html file.
In this markdown file, i have links in my table of content (linking to my headers), like this: `- [2. Liste des compétences couvertes](#2-liste-des-compétences-couvertes)`
My header looks like this: `## 2. Liste des compétences couvertes`
The link work when the file is processed into html and hosted on github.
The link doesn't work when im opening the file locally in my browser.
why is that ?


If the HTML generated by pandoc is stripping out the numbers at the beginning of the headers, resulting in the wrong id for the headers, then there are a couple of ways to fix this issue:

You can configure pandoc to keep the numbers at the beginning of the headers. This can usually be done by using the appropriate command-line options or by modifying the template used by pandoc.

You can use a pre-processing tool like sed or awk to add the numbers back in to the headers before running the pandoc command.

You can also use a post-processing tool like sed or awk to add the numbers back in to the headers after running the pandoc command.

You can also modify the markdown file and add the number yourself in front of the headers, like this: ## 2. Liste des compétences couvertes, this way you can be sure that the number will be present in the id of the header generated by pandoc

You can also use a custom filter for pandoc, which allows to modify the elements of the markdown file before they are transformed into HTML. You can find more information here : https://pandoc.org/filters.html

It's important to note that the solution that will work best for you will depend on the specific requirements of your project and your own skill set.
